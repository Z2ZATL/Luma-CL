# Luma Custom Language

## Overview

The Luma Custom Language is a programming language interpreter built in Rust. It implements a simple, readable syntax designed for clarity and ease of use. The language features variable assignment using natural language constructs (`let variable_name be value`), arithmetic operations with proper precedence, output commands (`show expression`), interactive REPL mode, and comprehensive error handling.

## System Architecture

The interpreter follows a traditional three-stage compilation pipeline:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)** - Converts raw source code into tokens
2. **Syntax Analysis (Parser)** - Transforms tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Interpretation (Interpreter)** - Executes the AST nodes directly

This architecture was chosen for its simplicity and educational value, making it easy to understand and extend. The modular design allows each component to be developed and tested independently.

## Key Components

### Token System (`src/token.rs`)
- Defines all language tokens including keywords (`Let`, `Be`, `Show`), operators (`Plus`, `Minus`, `Multiply`, `Divide`), and literals
- Implements operator precedence for proper arithmetic evaluation
- Provides display formatting for debugging and error messages

### Lexer (`src/lexer.rs`)
- Tokenizes input source code character by character
- Handles whitespace, comments (using `#`), and newlines
- Maintains line and column tracking for error reporting
- Returns a vector of tokens for parser consumption

### AST (`src/ast.rs`)
- Defines the abstract syntax tree structure with `Statement` and `Expression` enums
- Supports two statement types: variable assignment and output commands
- Expression types include literals, identifiers, and binary operations
- Uses boxed expressions for recursive tree structures

### Parser (`src/parser.rs`)
- Implements recursive descent parsing
- Converts token streams into AST structures
- Handles operator precedence for arithmetic expressions
- Provides comprehensive parse error reporting

### Interpreter (`src/interpreter.rs`)
- Executes AST nodes using a tree-walking approach
- Maintains variable state in a HashMap-based symbol table
- Evaluates expressions recursively with proper operator semantics
- Handles runtime errors like division by zero and undefined variables

### Error Handling (`src/error.rs`)
- Unified error system with four error types: Lexical, Parse, Runtime, and I/O
- Implements standard Rust error traits for proper error propagation
- Provides descriptive error messages for debugging

### REPL (`src/repl.rs`)
- Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for testing code snippets
- Supports utility commands (`help`, `vars`, `exit`)
- Maintains interpreter state across multiple inputs
- Provides immediate feedback for language experimentation

## Data Flow

1. **Input** → Raw source code (from file or REPL)
2. **Lexer** → Converts characters to tokens
3. **Parser** → Transforms tokens to AST
4. **Interpreter** → Executes AST nodes and maintains program state
5. **Output** → Results printed to console or errors displayed

The data flows linearly through each stage, with each component having a single responsibility. Error handling is propagated back through the chain to provide meaningful feedback to users.

## External Dependencies

The project currently has no external dependencies beyond the Rust standard library. This design choice prioritizes:
- Minimal complexity and faster compilation
- Educational clarity without external abstractions
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Self-contained learning experience

Future extensions may consider adding dependencies for advanced features like better error reporting or performance optimizations.

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured as a Rust binary that can be executed in two modes:
- **REPL Mode**: Interactive interpreter for testing (`cargo run`)
- **File Mode**: Execute `.luma` source files (`cargo run filename.luma`)

The binary is built using standard Rust tooling (`cargo build`) and can be distributed as a standalone executable. The modular architecture supports easy extension for additional deployment targets.
